# Analysis of Coupon Acceptance Rates

## Project Overview

This project explores the factors influencing drivers' decisions to accept various types of coupons delivered to their mobile devices while driving. The data, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository and collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, provides insights into how different factors such as destination, time of day, weather, and passenger presence affect coupon acceptance rates.

## Summary of Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights:
- **Time of Day**: Coupon acceptance rates peak at 2 PM and 7 AM, indicating higher coffee consumption during lunch breaks and morning routines.
- **Weather Conditions**: Coupons are more likely to be accepted during sunny and rainy weather, with lower acceptance during snowy conditions.
- **Income Range**: Consumers with incomes between $25,000 and $49,999 show the highest acceptance rates, suggesting a demographic with balanced discretionary spending.
- **Age Groups**: The '26-35' and '65+' age groups are most likely to accept coffee coupons, reflecting lifestyle preferences and routines.



## Jupyter Notebook

The analysis is thoroughly documented in the Jupyter notebook, which includes formatted headings and explanatory text to guide the reader through the process and findings.
